# React + Vite

  This is a Single Page Application. This contains more contents, a LOG IN section that oppenes a new content with a world MAP, live, API connected map. Here the user can choose a spot anywhere on the world and the app will take auttomatically the country name, the city name, the current data and by choice some notes from the user (a good place to visit, etc, etc). 
  There is also a button to go back 1 step. Possibility to find your own location. The spots and notes are saved in the browser store and even after reloads those info's will still be there and much more.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
